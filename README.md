# Determine The Form of The ARMA Model Equation in Time Series Analysis

in this time series analysis process include :
Plot data
Check data stationarity against Variance, using Box-Cox
Check the stationarity of the data against the Mean using the ADF Test
Plot ACF and PACF, then identify the order based on the ACF value, and PACF which experiences a cut-off after a certain lag
Choose the best model from several combinations of models obtained using the AIC value.
Parameter estimation uses the Maximum Likelihood method, then the significance of the parameters is tested.
Perform Feasibility Test of the model using Ljung-Box
Perform a residual normality test using Kolmogorof-Smirnov or Shapiro-Wilks.
Do forecasting, then calculate RMSE
